Work in progress

This is an experiment using Unity3D and physics simulation on GPU to render real-time the activity of a node on the Ethereum main-net blockchain.

Force directed graph (spring - electric forces) simulated directly into the GPU through th euse of compute shader to handle the real-time graph computation of a big amount of nodes and transactions
